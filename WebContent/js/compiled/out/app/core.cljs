; loading – Fires continuously when loading via XHR or drag'n'drop. Callback will receive (integer) loading progress in percents [0..100] and (object) event target.
; mouseup - When a mouse button goes up. Callback will receive MouseEvent object.
; pause – When audio is paused.
; play – When play starts.
; ready – When audio is loaded, decoded and the waveform drawn.
; scroll - When the scrollbar is moved. Callback will receive a ScrollEvent object.
; seek – On seeking. Callback will receive (float) progress [0..1].
; zoom – On zooming. Callback will receive (integer) minPxPerSec.
